__Currying can help you__
* make higher order factories.
* avoid continuously passing the same variables.
* memoize various things including state
* more


* `01.js` Functional composition
* `02.js` State with currying
* `03.js` Higher order functions
	> A higher order function is a function that does at least one of the following(Wikipedia):
	> 1. Takes one or more functions as an input  
	> 2. Outputs a function
* `04.js` A partial application
